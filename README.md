# Book Recommendation System
ABSTRACT
Recommender systems are now indispensable across diverse domains, including readership. This project explores various collaborative filtering techniques, focusing on Item-Based and User-Based methods. User-Based collaborative filtering uses correlation factors as similarity metrics. Clustering techniques like KNN, KMeans, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering were employed to build Item-Based recommender models. The study concludes with a comparative analysis of these models' performance across three dataset subsets.

METHODOLOGY

Exploratory Data Analysis
User-Based Collaborative Filtering using a correlation matrix
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering utilizing K-means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering

RESULTS

Ultimately, the model excels in recommending books based on either user input or book title. Across all three dataset subsets, Hierarchical Clustering emerged as the most effective method. This determination was made by considering factors such as silhouette scores, Calinski Harabasz scores, and Davies Bouldin scores.
